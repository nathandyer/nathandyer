## About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Nathan (He/Him), a Newsroom Support Engineer at Freedom of the Press Foundation. I provide support to news organizations that use [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org), help maintain documentation for the project, and work to bring SecureDrop to as many new organizations as possible. I've previously worked as a Customer Support Specialist for System76, a computer technican and systems administrator for a public school system, and as an AP Computer Science Principles instructor.

I'm a strong believer in open access to information, free software, knowledge sharing, preserving personal privacy, and the power of communities.

I maintain Vocal and Hypatia, two apps for Linux. I tinker with other random projects that pique my interests. I also like to contribute to larger projects like OpenStreetMaps, Wikipedia, and others. I sometimes blog on my personal website.

## Health and Productive Output ðŸ’Š

I have **stage 4 kidney disease** (IgA nephropathy). It is caused by a very rare **autoimmune disease called IgA vasculitis**.

I encourage you to read more about it if you're curious and have the stomach for it. I'm also always happy to talk about it or answer any questions you have. I do not get offended when asked about it, and am comfortable with frank discussions.

As a result of the kidney disease, I suffer from **chronic fatigue**, and often only have enough energy in a day to devote to my full-time job. I'm working to improve my productivity outside of work, and increase the amount of time I can contribute to other projects. Please be patient with me though, as my time is often constrained due to dealing with this extreme fatigue.

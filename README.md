## About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Nathan (He/Him), a Newsroom Support Engineer at Freedom of the Press Foundation. I provide support to news organizations that use [SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org), help maintain documentation for the project, and work to bring SecureDrop to as many new organizations as possible. I've previously worked as a Customer Support Specialist for System76, a computer technican and systems administrator for a public school system, and as an AP Computer Science Principles instructor.

I'm a strong believer in open access to information, free software, knowledge sharing, preserving personal privacy, and the power of communities.
